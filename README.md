# N423: Homework Three

This application is designed to facilitate the retrieval and display of data from local storage on a website. To achieve this, you need to have a good grasp of data manipulation techniques, including using JSON's stringify and parse functions. The application will require the creation of appropriate input fields to input student information, including their name, age, phone number, email address, and classes (stored as an array). Additionally, there will be a user-friendly button that allows you to trigger the display of this data on the web page. The interface will be thoughtfully styled for easy readability. Ultimately, this application will enable you to seamlessly add student records to local storage and effortlessly view a list of all students currently stored there.
